Throughout my childhood I have loved to play and watch various sports. In all sports that I
watched, I was always fascinated by the use of interesting graphs which displayed
performance of players, especially in cricket analysis. Though I found it a challenging topic to
study, I was determined to build a concept of how numbers could be used to make different
types of Graphs. Correlating the given data with statistics used in matches helped me grasp
the concept. I was thrilled to study the topic of Graphs including bar charts, box whisker plots
and stem leaf diagrams. I have been using these graphs to analyse scores of the friendly
matches that I play with my classmates. I have gained skills in inference and assessing impact
of numerous factors. I feel like I have a career prospect in a field which involves statistics.

my cricket coach once told me that i cannot catch low catches , he pointed out that it has to do
with my lower back . since then i took extra time to practice sliding and diving and doing
specific exercises for my lower back. i also used my goalkeeper training from football to
overcome my weakness .
